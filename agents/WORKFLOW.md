# Agent Workflow

This document describes the full lifecycle of an issue through the agent system for the `dvlprlife/vibe-coding` repository.

## Agents

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Repo Check | `repo-check.md` | Ensures all required labels exist in the repo |
| Issue Planner | `issue-planner.md` | Reviews issues and writes implementation plans |
| Issue Worker | `issue-worker.md` | Implements changes, commits, and opens a PR |
| PR Reviewer | `pr-reviewer.md` | Reviews the PR against the plan, AC, code quality, and CLAUDE.md |

---

## Issue Lifecycle

### 1. Setup (Repo Check Agent)
Run once before using the other agents to ensure all required labels exist.

```
agent: repo-check
```

---

### 2. Issue Created by Human
A human creates an issue and applies the following labels to queue it for agent processing:

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `agent` | Marks the issue for agent pickup |
| `status: need plan` | Signals the issue planner to review it |

---

### 3. Planning (Issue Planner Agent)
The planner finds issues labeled `agent` + `status: need plan`.

**Happy path — enough information:**
1. Posts an `## Implementation Plan` comment (file-by-file changes + acceptance criteria)
2. Removes `status: need plan`, adds `status: ready`

**Failure path — not enough information:**
1. Adds `status: follow up` and `human` labels, removes `agent`
2. Posts a `## Needs Clarification` comment explaining what is missing
3. Stops — human intervention required

---

### 4. Implementation (Issue Worker Agent)
The worker finds issues labeled `agent` + `status: ready`.

1. Swaps `status: ready` → `status: in-progress`
2. Verifies an `## Implementation Plan` comment exists — if not, transitions back to `status: need plan` and stops
3. Creates a branch, implements the changes, commits, and pushes
4. Opens a PR referencing the issue
5. Swaps `status: in-progress` → `status: in-review`
6. Posts a comment on the issue linking to the PR

---

### 4.5. Automated Review (PR Reviewer Agent)
The reviewer finds issues labeled `agent` + `status: in-review`.

1. Locates the open PR referencing the issue (`Closes #{number}`)
2. Gathers the issue body, the `## Implementation Plan` comment, the PR, and the diff
3. Reviews against four criteria: Implementation Plan adherence, Acceptance Criteria, code quality, and CLAUDE.md compliance
4. Posts a review on the PR (request changes if findings exist, comment review otherwise — agents cannot self-approve)
5. Posts a summary comment on the issue

**If findings:** adds `status: follow up` + `human`, removes `status: in-review`.
**If clean:** adds `status: agent approved`, removes `status: in-review`.

---

### 5. Review (Human)
A human reviews the PR. On merge the issue is closed.
